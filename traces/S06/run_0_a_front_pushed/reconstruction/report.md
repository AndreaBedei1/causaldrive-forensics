# Reconstruction report - S06/run_0_a_front_pushed

Inputs: `vehicles/A/`, `vehicles/B/`, `vehicles/C/` (vehicle-local files) and the supplied `incident_context.json`. `ground_truth/` and the run's `metadata.json` were not read; the privileged comparison, if run, is in `evaluation/`.

Speed limit 50 km/h, supplied as incident context: known a priori, not perceived and not ground truth.

Pipeline: raw log -> local trace -> local graph (each recorder alone, own clock, own frame) -> graph-level alignment -> identity association -> global graph.

## Local reconstructions

| Recorder | Duration (local) | Trace frames | Graph nodes | Graph edges | Radar tracks | Collision reports (local time) |
|----------|-----------------:|-------------:|------------:|------------:|-------------:|-------------------------------|
| A | 13.70 s | 138 | 13 | 20 | 1 | A:e08 @ 4.80 s, A:e13 @ 5.45 s |
| B | 13.70 s | 138 | 15 | 25 | 1 | B:e08 @ 4.80 s, B:e10 @ 5.30 s |
| C | 13.70 s | 138 | 7 | 10 | 0 | C:e07 @ 5.30 s |

## Graph alignment

Reference event: `collision_001` (t_global = 0); `t_global = t_local + offset_to_global`. A graph that did not report it is aligned through the chain of matched collisions linking it to the reference (multi-hop); its anchor is its own report of the last collision of that chain.

| Graph | Status | Anchor node | Anchor local time | Offset to global | Note |
|-------|--------|-------------|------------------:|-----------------:|------|
| A | ALIGNED | A:e08 | 4.80 | -4.80 | reported the reference collision collision_001 |
| B | ALIGNED | B:e08 | 4.80 | -4.80 | reported the reference collision collision_001 |
| C | ALIGNED | C:e07 | 5.30 | -4.80 | shares collision_003 with B, aligned through collision_001 -> collision_003 |

Estimated relative clock offsets: B - A = +0.000 s, C - A = +0.000 s, C - B = +0.000 s

Matched `collision_001`: A and B both recorded a collision; peak impulses 10281.41 vs 10281.41 N*s (similarity 1.000, tolerance 0.10); no competing report within tolerance

Matched `collision_002`: A recorded a collision; B recorded the same impulse as a burst within its contact B:e10, merged there by its own sensor; peak impulses 1509.76 vs 1509.76 N*s (similarity 1.000, tolerance 0.10); consistent with the clock offset between A and B that earlier matches fix (+0.000 s, tolerance 0.10 s)

Matched `collision_003`: B and C both recorded a collision; peak impulses 8788.05 vs 8788.05 N*s (similarity 1.000, tolerance 0.10); no competing report within tolerance

## Identity associations

| Local track | Global entity | Status | Confidence | Evidence |
|-------------|---------------|--------|-----------:|----------|

### Temporal safety relations

CUT_IN_START < CRITICAL_TTC_START < COLLISION, or CRITICAL_TTC_START <= CUT_IN_START (critical TTC already active), and EGO_PATH_ENTRY before/after the critical TTC. Temporal order only, not causes.

- A's track_001 (B): CRITICAL_TTC_START 0.50, COLLISION with B 4.80 (+4.30 s) [local times; t_global: critical_ttc_start -4.30, collision +0.00]
- B's track_001 (C): CRITICAL_TTC_START 0.50, COLLISION with C 5.30 (+4.80 s) [local times; t_global: critical_ttc_start -4.30, collision +0.50]

### Simultaneous events (order unresolved at 0.05 s)

- MOVING_START(A); MOVING_START(B); MOVING_START(C); THROTTLE_START(A); THROTTLE_START(B); THROTTLE_START(C); TRACK_APPEARED_FRONT(A,B); TRACK_APPEARED_FRONT(B,C)
- CRITICAL_TTC_START(A,B); CRITICAL_TTC_START(B,C)
- THROTTLE_END(C); BRAKE_START(C)
- THROTTLE_END(B); BRAKE_START(B)
- MOVING_END(C); STOP_START(C)
- THROTTLE_END(A); BRAKE_START(A)
- CRITICAL_TTC_END(A,B); CLOSING_END(A,B)
- COLLISION(B,C); CRITICAL_TTC_END(B,C); CLOSING_END(B,C)
- MOVING_END(A); STOP_START(A)
- COLLISION(A,B); MOVING_END(B); STOP_START(B); BRAKE_START(B)

### States still active when observation ended

A:
- BRAKE, since A:e07 (t = 4.55 s)
- STOP, since A:e12 (t = 5.35 s)
B:
- STOP, since B:e14 (t = 5.45 s)
- BRAKE, since B:e15 (t = 5.45 s)
C:
- BRAKE, since C:e04 (t = 2.95 s)
- STOP, since C:e06 (t = 4.05 s)

### Sign detection windows

A:
- none
B:
- none
C:
- none

### Perceived state just before each collision report

- A A:e08 at 4.80 s (local): ego: MOVING, BRAKE; track_001: CLOSING, CRITICAL_TTC, IN_EGO_PATH
- A A:e13 at 5.45 s (local): ego: STOP, BRAKE; track_001: IN_EGO_PATH
- B B:e08 at 4.80 s (local): ego: MOVING, BRAKE; track_001: CLOSING, CRITICAL_TTC, IN_EGO_PATH
- B B:e10 at 5.30 s (local): ego: MOVING; track_001: CLOSING, CRITICAL_TTC, IN_EGO_PATH
- C C:e07 at 5.30 s (local): ego: STOP, BRAKE

### Tracks lost while a state was active

A lost track's states become UNKNOWN: the recorder can no longer tell whether they ended.

A:
- no track was lost
B:
- no track was lost
C:
- no track was lost

## Uncertainty and limitations

- C built no radar track: nothing moving stayed in its radar view long enough, so C has no perception of the others.
- Global time rests on matched collisions (t_global = 0 at the reference one) and a constant offset per recorder; clock drift is not modelled, so timing uncertainty grows away from the collisions that align each recorder.
- Radar tracks follow the visible surface of an object, not its centre, and a straight-ahead corridor is used for 'in path'.
