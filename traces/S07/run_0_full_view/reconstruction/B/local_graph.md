# Local graph - vehicle B

All times are B's own local clock: `t_local` = seconds since B's first ego sample (raw clock reading 68.30776481702924 at `t_local` = 0). Only files under `vehicles/B/` were read; external objects are anonymous radar tracks.

- Local frame: origin = first ego position; x = first heading; y = to the right of the first heading (CARLA convention)
- Trace: 143 frames at 10 Hz in `local_trace.jsonl`, the last one at the recording end (14.15 s)
- Anonymous radar tracks: 1 (10 Hz samples in `local_tracks.jsonl`)
- Speed limit 50 km/h, supplied as incident context: known a priori, not perceived and not ground truth.
- Nodes: 12; edges: 19 (PRECEDES 13, SAME_TRACK 6)

Events are state transitions; the quantities behind them (speed, pedals, ranges, TTC, relative motion, closest approach) are facts in `local_trace.jsonl`. Events with equal times are simultaneous at the recorder's resolution: PRECEDES links only different times. SAME_TRACK links a track's TRACK_APPEARED_* to every other event about the same local track (grouping only, no order).

## Perceived state before each event

Each row is the state just BEFORE its events (none of them applied): events at one time are simultaneous and share it. True states are named, unknown ones end with `?`, false ones are omitted; a lost track's states are UNKNOWN, never ended. Facts: the trace frame at the time shown.

## States still active when observation ended

- BRAKE, since B:e06 (t = 3.65 s)
- STOP, since B:e11 (t = 4.85 s)

## Tracks lost

- no track was lost

## Temporal safety relations

Order of each track's cut-in, critical TTC and path entry and of the collision report, in local time. Temporal properties only, not causes.

- track_001: CRITICAL_TTC_START 3.95, COLLISION 5.70 (+1.75 s)

## Sign detection windows

- none

An END means this recorder stopped detecting the sign, not that its obligation ended.

## Anonymous radar tracks

| Track | First seen | Last seen | Measured sweeps | First range / bearing | Min range (at) | Last range / bearing | Max speed |
|-------|-----------:|----------:|----------------:|----------------------|----------------|---------------------|----------:|
| track_001 | 0.00 | 14.15 | 284 | 21.8 m / -0 deg | 10.77 m (4.90) | 12.0 m / -0 deg | 14.4 m/s |

Bearing: positive = to B's right. Ranges are measured from the radar to the visible surface of the object.

## Plain-language reading

- t = 0.00 s: B started moving (already the case when first observed).
- t = 0.00 s: B's radar started tracking track_001, which appeared in front of it.
- t = 1.10 s: B observed track_001 start closing in.
- t = 2.10 s: B observed track_001 stop closing in.
- t = 3.25 s: B observed track_001 start closing in.
- t = 3.65 s: B started braking.
- t = 3.95 s: B's time-to-contact with track_001 became critical.
- t = 4.60 s: B's time-to-contact with track_001 stopped being critical.
- t = 4.85 s: B observed track_001 stop closing in.
- t = 4.85 s: B stopped moving.
- t = 4.85 s: B came to a stop.
- t = 5.70 s: B's collision sensor recorded a contact (peak impulse 31407 N*s).
