# Reconstruction report - S10/run_0_rolls_through

Inputs: `vehicles/A/`, `vehicles/B/` (vehicle-local files) and the supplied `incident_context.json`. `ground_truth/` and the run's `metadata.json` were not read; the privileged comparison, if run, is in `evaluation/`.

Speed limit 50 km/h, supplied as incident context: known a priori, not perceived and not ground truth.

Pipeline: raw log -> local trace -> local graph (each recorder alone, own clock, own frame) -> graph-level alignment -> identity association -> global graph.

## Local reconstructions

| Recorder | Duration (local) | Trace frames | Graph nodes | Graph edges | Radar tracks | Collision reports (local time) |
|----------|-----------------:|-------------:|------------:|------------:|-------------:|-------------------------------|
| A | 15.95 s | 161 | 21 | 39 | 1 | A:e14 @ 5.40 s |
| B | 15.95 s | 161 | 13 | 25 | 1 | B:e07 @ 5.40 s |

## Graph alignment

Reference event: `collision_001` (t_global = 0); `t_global = t_local + offset_to_global`. A graph that did not report it is aligned through the chain of matched collisions linking it to the reference (multi-hop); its anchor is its own report of the last collision of that chain.

| Graph | Status | Anchor node | Anchor local time | Offset to global | Note |
|-------|--------|-------------|------------------:|-----------------:|------|
| A | ALIGNED | A:e14 | 5.40 | -5.40 | reported the reference collision collision_001 |
| B | ALIGNED | B:e07 | 5.40 | -5.40 | reported the reference collision collision_001 |

Estimated relative clock offsets: B - A = +0.000 s

Matched `collision_001`: A and B both recorded a collision; peak impulses 12940.27 vs 12940.27 N*s (similarity 1.000, tolerance 0.10); no competing report within tolerance

## Identity associations

| Local track | Global entity | Status | Confidence | Evidence |
|-------------|---------------|--------|-----------:|----------|
| A:track_001 | B | ASSOCIATED | 0.99 | A and B both reported collision_001 (peak impulse 12940.27 vs 12940.27 N*s)<br>tracked for 2.80 s before the matched collision<br>continuous up to the contact: last observed 0.00 s before it (window 1.00 s)<br>approaching before the contact: clearance 12.6 m -> 0.1 m over the last 1.0 s<br>track speed agrees with B's own speed: RMSE 0.18 m/s over 2.8 s<br>clearance at the contact 0.09 m<br>the only track of A compatible with the contact |

## Global graph

33 nodes, 78 edges; 1 merged node(s): g20 COLLISION(A,B) from A:e14 + B:e07.

### Temporal safety relations

CUT_IN_START < CRITICAL_TTC_START < COLLISION, or CRITICAL_TTC_START <= CUT_IN_START (critical TTC already active), and EGO_PATH_ENTRY before/after the critical TTC. Temporal order only, not causes.

- A's track_001 (B): CRITICAL_TTC_START 3.40, COLLISION with B 5.40 (+2.00 s); EGO_PATH_ENTRY 5.30 after critical TTC (+1.90 s) [local times; t_global: critical_ttc_start -2.00, ego_path_entry -0.10, collision +0.00]
- B's track_001 (unidentified B:track_001): CRITICAL_TTC_START 3.60, COLLISION 5.40 (+1.80 s); EGO_PATH_ENTRY 5.25 after critical TTC (+1.65 s) [local times; t_global: critical_ttc_start -1.80, ego_path_entry -0.15, collision +0.00]

### Simultaneous events (order unresolved at 0.05 s)

- MOVING_START(A); MOVING_START(B); THROTTLE_START(A); THROTTLE_START(B)
- THROTTLE_END(A); BRAKE_START(A)
- TRACK_APPEARED_LEFT(A,B); CLOSING_START(A,B)
- TRACK_APPEARED_RIGHT(B,B:track_001); CLOSING_START(B,B:track_001)
- BRAKE_END(A); THROTTLE_START(A)
- COLLISION(A,B); CRITICAL_TTC_END(A,B); CRITICAL_TTC_END(B,B:track_001); CLOSING_END(B,B:track_001); TURN_LEFT_END(A)
- CLOSING_END(A,B); THROTTLE_END(A); THROTTLE_END(B); BRAKE_START(A); BRAKE_START(B)
- MOVING_END(A); STOP_START(A)
- MOVING_END(B); STOP_START(B)

### States still active when observation ended

A:
- EGO_PATH of track_001, since A:e13 (t = 5.30 s)
- BRAKE, since A:e19 (t = 5.45 s)
- STOP, since A:e21 (t = 5.50 s)
B:
- EGO_PATH of track_001, since B:e06 (t = 5.25 s)
- BRAKE, since B:e11 (t = 5.45 s)
- STOP, since B:e13 (t = 5.60 s)

### Sign detection windows

A:
- STOP sign sign-0: detected 1.15 s -> 2.75 s; relevant to the path: True; STOP_START inside: none
B:
- none

### Perceived state just before each collision report

- A A:e14 at 5.40 s (local): ego: MOVING, THROTTLE, TURN_LEFT; track_001: CLOSING, CRITICAL_TTC, IN_EGO_PATH; sign-0: STOP sign known, relevant to the path
- B B:e07 at 5.40 s (local): ego: MOVING, THROTTLE; track_001: CLOSING, CRITICAL_TTC, IN_EGO_PATH

### Tracks lost while a state was active

A lost track's states become UNKNOWN: the recorder can no longer tell whether they ended.

A:
- no track was lost
B:
- no track was lost

## Uncertainty and limitations

- B:track_001 stays anonymous: track speed disagrees with A's own speed: RMSE 1.61 m/s over 2.7 s (> 1.50).
- Global time rests on matched collisions (t_global = 0 at the reference one) and a constant offset per recorder; clock drift is not modelled, so timing uncertainty grows away from the collisions that align each recorder.
- Radar tracks follow the visible surface of an object, not its centre, and a straight-ahead corridor is used for 'in path'.
