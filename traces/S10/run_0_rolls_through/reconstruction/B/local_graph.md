# Local graph - vehicle B

All times are B's own local clock: `t_local` = seconds since B's first ego sample (raw clock reading 165.16541194915771 at `t_local` = 0). Only files under `vehicles/B/` were read; external objects are anonymous radar tracks.

- Local frame: origin = first ego position; x = first heading; y = to the right of the first heading (CARLA convention)
- Trace: 161 frames at 10 Hz in `local_trace.jsonl`, the last one at the recording end (15.95 s)
- Anonymous radar tracks: 1 (10 Hz samples in `local_tracks.jsonl`)
- Speed limit 50 km/h, supplied as incident context: known a priori, not perceived and not ground truth.
- Nodes: 13; edges: 25 (PRECEDES 20, SAME_TRACK 5)

Events are state transitions; the quantities behind them (speed, pedals, ranges, TTC, relative motion, closest approach) are facts in `local_trace.jsonl`. Events with equal times are simultaneous at the recorder's resolution: PRECEDES links only different times. SAME_TRACK links a track's TRACK_APPEARED_* to every other event about the same local track (grouping only, no order).

## Perceived state before each event

Each row is the state just BEFORE its events (none of them applied): events at one time are simultaneous and share it. True states are named, unknown ones end with `?`, false ones are omitted; a lost track's states are UNKNOWN, never ended. Facts: the trace frame at the time shown.

## States still active when observation ended

- EGO_PATH of track_001, since B:e06 (t = 5.25 s)
- BRAKE, since B:e11 (t = 5.45 s)
- STOP, since B:e13 (t = 5.60 s)

## Tracks lost

- no track was lost

## Temporal safety relations

Order of each track's cut-in, critical TTC and path entry and of the collision report, in local time. Temporal properties only, not causes.

- track_001: CRITICAL_TTC_START 3.60, COLLISION 5.40 (+1.80 s); EGO_PATH_ENTRY 5.25 after critical TTC (+1.65 s)

## Sign detection windows

- none

An END means this recorder stopped detecting the sign, not that its obligation ended.

## Anonymous radar tracks

| Track | First seen | Last seen | Measured sweeps | First range / bearing | Min range (at) | Last range / bearing | Max speed |
|-------|-----------:|----------:|----------------:|----------------------|----------------|---------------------|----------:|
| track_001 | 2.70 | 15.95 | 266 | 34.0 m / +21 deg | 0.55 m (15.95) | 0.6 m / +10 deg | 7.1 m/s |

Bearing: positive = to B's right. Ranges are measured from the radar to the visible surface of the object.

## Plain-language reading

- t = 0.00 s: B started moving (already the case when first observed).
- t = 0.00 s: B pressed the accelerator (already the case when first observed).
- t = 2.70 s: B's radar started tracking track_001, which appeared on its right.
- t = 2.70 s: B observed track_001 start closing in (already the case when first observed).
- t = 3.60 s: B's time-to-contact with track_001 became critical.
- t = 5.25 s: B observed track_001 enter its forward path corridor.
- t = 5.40 s: B's collision sensor recorded a contact (peak impulse 12940 N*s).
- t = 5.40 s: B's time-to-contact with track_001 stopped being critical.
- t = 5.40 s: B observed track_001 stop closing in.
- t = 5.45 s: B released the accelerator.
- t = 5.45 s: B started braking.
- t = 5.60 s: B stopped moving.
- t = 5.60 s: B came to a stop.
