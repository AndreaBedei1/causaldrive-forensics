# Reconstruction report - S03/run_0_crash

Inputs: `vehicles/A/`, `vehicles/B/` (vehicle-local files) and the supplied `incident_context.json`. `ground_truth/` and the run's `metadata.json` were not read; the privileged comparison, if run, is in `evaluation/`.

Speed limit 50 km/h, supplied as incident context: known a priori, not perceived and not ground truth.

Pipeline: raw log -> local trace -> local graph (each recorder alone, own clock, own frame) -> graph-level alignment -> identity association -> global graph.

## Local reconstructions

| Recorder | Duration (local) | Trace frames | Graph nodes | Graph edges | Radar tracks | Collision reports (local time) |
|----------|-----------------:|-------------:|------------:|------------:|-------------:|-------------------------------|
| A | 15.15 s | 153 | 9 | 12 | 1 | A:e06 @ 4.25 s |
| B | 15.15 s | 153 | 12 | 21 | 1 | B:e06 @ 4.25 s |

## Graph alignment

Reference event: `collision_001` (t_global = 0); `t_global = t_local + offset_to_global`. A graph that did not report it is aligned through the chain of matched collisions linking it to the reference (multi-hop); its anchor is its own report of the last collision of that chain.

| Graph | Status | Anchor node | Anchor local time | Offset to global | Note |
|-------|--------|-------------|------------------:|-----------------:|------|
| A | ALIGNED | A:e06 | 4.25 | -4.25 | reported the reference collision collision_001 |
| B | ALIGNED | B:e06 | 4.25 | -4.25 | reported the reference collision collision_001 |

Estimated relative clock offsets: B - A = +0.000 s

Matched `collision_001`: A and B both recorded a collision; peak impulses 12077.22 vs 12077.22 N*s (similarity 1.000, tolerance 0.10); no competing report within tolerance

## Identity associations

| Local track | Global entity | Status | Confidence | Evidence |
|-------------|---------------|--------|-----------:|----------|
| A:track_001 | B | ASSOCIATED | 0.96 | A and B both reported collision_001 (peak impulse 12077.22 vs 12077.22 N*s)<br>tracked for 2.20 s before the matched collision<br>continuous up to the contact: last observed 0.15 s before it (window 0.50 s)<br>approaching before the contact: range 18.6 m -> 3.8 m over the last 1.0 s<br>track speed agrees with B's own speed: RMSE 0.38 m/s over 2.0 s<br>range at the contact 3.78 m (beyond 3.50 m: confidence factor 1.00)<br>the only track of A compatible with the contact |

## Global graph

20 nodes, 37 edges; 1 merged node(s): g11 COLLISION(A,B) from A:e06 + B:e06.

### What happened, in plain language

- 4.25 s before the reference collision, A started moving (already the case when first observed).
- 4.25 s before the reference collision, B started moving (already the case when first observed).
- 2.20 s before the reference collision, A's radar started tracking B, which appeared on its right.
- 2.20 s before the reference collision, A observed B start closing in (already the case when first observed).
- 2.05 s before the reference collision, B's radar started tracking A, which appeared on its left.
- 2.05 s before the reference collision, B observed A start closing in (already the case when first observed).
- 1.90 s before the reference collision, B's time-to-contact with A became critical.
- 1.80 s before the reference collision, A's time-to-contact with B became critical.
- 0.15 s before the reference collision, A's radar lost B (its states are UNKNOWN from then on, not ended).
- 0.10 s before the reference collision, B observed A enter its forward path corridor.
- At the reference collision, A and B both recorded this same collision (peak impulses A: 12077, B: 12077 N*s).
- 0.05 s after the reference collision, A started braking.
- 0.05 s after the reference collision, B started braking.
- 0.10 s after the reference collision, B's time-to-contact with A stopped being critical.
- 0.10 s after the reference collision, B observed A stop closing in.
- 0.30 s after the reference collision, B stopped moving.
- 0.30 s after the reference collision, B came to a stop.
- 0.45 s after the reference collision, B observed A leave its forward path corridor.
- 0.65 s after the reference collision, A stopped moving.
- 0.65 s after the reference collision, A came to a stop.

### Temporal safety relations

CUT_IN_START < CRITICAL_TTC_START < COLLISION, or CRITICAL_TTC_START <= CUT_IN_START (critical TTC already active), and EGO_PATH_ENTRY before/after the critical TTC. Temporal order only, not causes.

- A's track_001 (B): CRITICAL_TTC_START 2.45, COLLISION with B 4.25 (+1.80 s) [local times; t_global: critical_ttc_start -1.80, collision +0.00]
- B's track_001 (A): CRITICAL_TTC_START 2.35, COLLISION with A 4.25 (+1.90 s); EGO_PATH_ENTRY 4.15 after critical TTC (+1.80 s) [local times; t_global: critical_ttc_start -1.90, ego_path_entry -0.10, collision +0.00]

### Simultaneous events (order unresolved at 0.05 s)

- MOVING_START(A); MOVING_START(B)
- TRACK_APPEARED_RIGHT(A,B); CLOSING_START(A,B)
- TRACK_APPEARED_LEFT(B,A); CLOSING_START(B,A)
- BRAKE_START(A); BRAKE_START(B)
- CRITICAL_TTC_END(B,A); CLOSING_END(B,A)
- MOVING_END(B); STOP_START(B)
- MOVING_END(A); STOP_START(A)

### States still active when observation ended

A:
- CLOSING of track_001, since A:e03 (t = 2.05 s); the track was lost at 4.10 s
- CRITICAL_TTC of track_001, since A:e04 (t = 2.45 s); the track was lost at 4.10 s
- BRAKE, since A:e07 (t = 4.30 s)
- STOP, since A:e09 (t = 4.90 s)
B:
- BRAKE, since B:e07 (t = 4.30 s)
- STOP, since B:e11 (t = 4.55 s)

### Sign detection windows

A:
- none
B:
- none

### Perceived state just before each collision report

- A A:e06 at 4.25 s (local): ego: MOVING; track lost, states UNKNOWN: track_001
- B B:e06 at 4.25 s (local): ego: MOVING; track_001: CLOSING, CRITICAL_TTC, IN_EGO_PATH

### Tracks lost while a state was active

A lost track's states become UNKNOWN: the recorder can no longer tell whether they ended.

A:
- track_001 at 4.10 s (A:e05): CLOSING, CRITICAL_TTC were true; they are UNKNOWN afterwards (no END recorded)
B:
- no track was lost

## Uncertainty and limitations

- Global time rests on matched collisions (t_global = 0 at the reference one) and a constant offset per recorder; clock drift is not modelled, so timing uncertainty grows away from the collisions that align each recorder.
- Radar tracks follow the visible surface of an object, not its centre, and a straight-ahead corridor is used for 'in path'.
