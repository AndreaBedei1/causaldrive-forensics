# Local graph - vehicle C

All times are C's own local clock: `t_local` = seconds since C's first ego sample (raw clock reading 224.2758263722062 at `t_local` = 0). Only files under `vehicles/C/` were read; external objects are anonymous radar tracks.

- Local frame: origin = first ego position; x = first heading; y = to the right of the first heading (CARLA convention)
- Trace: 121 frames at 10 Hz in `local_trace.jsonl`, the last one at the recording end (11.95 s)
- Anonymous radar tracks: 1 (10 Hz samples in `local_tracks.jsonl`)
- Speed limit 50 km/h, supplied as incident context: known a priori, not perceived and not ground truth.
- Nodes: 13; edges: 21 (PRECEDES 16, SAME_TRACK 5)

Events are state transitions; the quantities behind them (speed, pedals, ranges, TTC, relative motion, closest approach) are facts in `local_trace.jsonl`. Events with equal times are simultaneous at the recorder's resolution: PRECEDES links only different times. SAME_TRACK links a track's TRACK_APPEARED_* to every other event about the same local track (grouping only, no order).

## Perceived state before each event

Each row is the state just BEFORE its events (none of them applied): events at one time are simultaneous and share it. True states are named, unknown ones end with `?`, false ones are omitted; a lost track's states are UNKNOWN, never ended. Facts: the trace frame at the time shown.

## States still active when observation ended

- CLOSING of track_001, since C:e06 (t = 5.55 s); the track was lost at 6.45 s
- CRITICAL_TTC of track_001, since C:e07 (t = 5.60 s); the track was lost at 6.45 s
- BRAKE, since C:e11 (t = 6.65 s)
- STOP, since C:e13 (t = 7.45 s)

## Tracks lost

- track_001 at 6.45 s (C:e08): CLOSING, CRITICAL_TTC were true; they are UNKNOWN afterwards (no END recorded)

## Temporal safety relations

Order of each track's cut-in, critical TTC and path entry and of the collision report, in local time. Temporal properties only, not causes.

- track_001: CRITICAL_TTC_START 5.60, COLLISION 6.60 (+1.00 s)

## Sign detection windows

- none

An END means this recorder stopped detecting the sign, not that its obligation ended.

## Anonymous radar tracks

| Track | First seen | Last seen | Measured sweeps | First range / bearing | Min range (at) | Last range / bearing | Max speed |
|-------|-----------:|----------:|----------------:|----------------------|----------------|---------------------|----------:|
| track_001 | 2.65 | 6.45 | 77 | 8.9 m / +154 deg | 3.01 m (6.45) | 3.0 m / +143 deg | 11.7 m/s |

Bearing: positive = to C's right. Ranges are measured from the radar to the visible surface of the object.

## Plain-language reading

- t = 0.00 s: C started moving (already the case when first observed).
- t = 0.00 s: C pressed the accelerator (already the case when first observed).
- t = 2.65 s: C's radar started tracking track_001, which appeared on its right.
- t = 2.65 s: C observed track_001 start closing in (already the case when first observed).
- t = 4.40 s: C observed track_001 stop closing in.
- t = 5.55 s: C observed track_001 start closing in.
- t = 5.60 s: C's time-to-contact with track_001 became critical.
- t = 6.45 s: C's radar lost track_001 (its states are UNKNOWN from then on, not ended).
- t = 6.60 s: C's collision sensor recorded a contact (peak impulse 322 N*s).
- t = 6.65 s: C released the accelerator.
- t = 6.65 s: C started braking.
- t = 7.45 s: C stopped moving.
- t = 7.45 s: C came to a stop.
