# Reconstruction report - S11/run_0_stops_safely

Inputs: `vehicles/A/`, `vehicles/B/` (vehicle-local files) and the supplied `incident_context.json`. `ground_truth/` and the run's `metadata.json` were not read; the privileged comparison, if run, is in `evaluation/`.

Speed limit 50 km/h, supplied as incident context: known a priori, not perceived and not ground truth.

Pipeline: raw log -> local trace -> local graph (each recorder alone, own clock, own frame) -> graph-level alignment -> identity association -> global graph.

## Local reconstructions

| Recorder | Duration (local) | Trace frames | Graph nodes | Graph edges | Radar tracks | Collision reports (local time) |
|----------|-----------------:|-------------:|------------:|------------:|-------------:|-------------------------------|
| A | 9.55 s | 97 | 7 | 12 | 1 | none |
| B | 9.55 s | 97 | 11 | 17 | 1 | none |

## Graph alignment

No collision was matched across recorders, so no local graph could be aligned; every event keeps only its local time (radar-only alignment is not implemented).

| Graph | Status | Anchor node | Anchor local time | Offset to global | Note |
|-------|--------|-------------|------------------:|-----------------:|------|
| A | UNALIGNED | - | - | - | it recorded no collision to anchor on |
| B | UNALIGNED | - | - | - | it recorded no collision to anchor on |

## Identity associations

| Local track | Global entity | Status | Confidence | Evidence |
|-------------|---------------|--------|-----------:|----------|
| A:track_001 | A:track_001 | ANONYMOUS | - | graph A is not aligned: it recorded no collision to anchor on |
| B:track_001 | B:track_001 | ANONYMOUS | - | graph B is not aligned: it recorded no collision to anchor on |

## Global graph

18 nodes, 9 edges; 0 merged node(s): none.

### Event sequence (global time)

- (none)

### What happened, in plain language

- (unaligned, A local time 0.00 s) A started moving (already the case when first observed).
- (unaligned, A local time 2.65 s) A's radar started tracking unidentified object A:track_001, which appeared on its right.
- (unaligned, A local time 2.65 s) A observed unidentified object A:track_001 start closing in (already the case when first observed).
- (unaligned, A local time 4.40 s) A's time-to-contact with unidentified object A:track_001 became critical.
- (unaligned, A local time 5.65 s) A's time-to-contact with unidentified object A:track_001 stopped being critical.
- (unaligned, A local time 6.05 s) A observed unidentified object A:track_001 stop closing in.
- (unaligned, A local time 9.50 s) A's radar lost unidentified object A:track_001 (its states are UNKNOWN from then on, not ended).
- (unaligned, B local time 0.00 s) B started moving (already the case when first observed).
- (unaligned, B local time 2.00 s) B's camera established a STOP sign detection (unidentified object B:sign-1) (the detector judged it not relevant to its path).
- (unaligned, B local time 2.40 s) B's camera stopped detecting STOP sign unidentified object B:sign-1.
- (unaligned, B local time 2.55 s) B started braking.
- (unaligned, B local time 2.75 s) B's radar started tracking unidentified object B:track_001, which appeared on its left.
- (unaligned, B local time 2.75 s) B observed unidentified object B:track_001 start closing in (already the case when first observed).
- (unaligned, B local time 3.25 s) B stopped moving.
- (unaligned, B local time 3.25 s) B came to a stop.
- (unaligned, B local time 5.80 s) B observed unidentified object B:track_001 enter its forward path corridor.
- (unaligned, B local time 6.10 s) B observed unidentified object B:track_001 stop closing in.
- (unaligned, B local time 6.20 s) B observed unidentified object B:track_001 leave its forward path corridor.

### Temporal safety relations

CUT_IN_START < CRITICAL_TTC_START < COLLISION, or CRITICAL_TTC_START <= CUT_IN_START (critical TTC already active), and EGO_PATH_ENTRY before/after the critical TTC. Temporal order only, not causes.

- A's track_001 (unidentified A:track_001): CRITICAL_TTC_START 4.40 [local times]
- B's track_001 (unidentified B:track_001): EGO_PATH_ENTRY 5.80, no critical TTC [local times]

### Simultaneous events (order unresolved at 0.05 s)

- none

### States still active when observation ended

A:
- MOVING, since A:e01 (t = 0.00 s)
B:
- BRAKE, since B:e04 (t = 2.55 s)
- STOP, since B:e08 (t = 3.25 s)

### Sign detection windows

A:
- none
B:
- STOP sign sign-1: detected 2.00 s -> 2.40 s; relevant to the path: False; STOP_START inside: none

### Perceived state just before each collision report

- no collision was reported

### Tracks lost while a state was active

A lost track's states become UNKNOWN: the recorder can no longer tell whether they ended.

A:
- lost with no state active: track_001
B:
- no track was lost

## Uncertainty and limitations

- A:track_001 stays anonymous: graph A is not aligned: it recorded no collision to anchor on.
- B:track_001 stays anonymous: graph B is not aligned: it recorded no collision to anchor on.
- A is UNALIGNED: it recorded no collision to anchor on.
- B is UNALIGNED: it recorded no collision to anchor on.
- Global time rests on matched collisions (t_global = 0 at the reference one) and a constant offset per recorder; clock drift is not modelled, so timing uncertainty grows away from the collisions that align each recorder.
- Radar tracks follow the visible surface of an object, not its centre, and a straight-ahead corridor is used for 'in path'.
