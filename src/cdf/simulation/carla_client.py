"""Connection and process management for the CARLA simulator.

This module exists because a bare ``carla.Client`` is not robust enough to drive
a long experiment suite unattended. Three failure modes were observed on the
reference machine and are handled here explicitly:

1. ``client.load_world(X)`` while the server is **already running map X** crashes
   the server. :func:`ensure_map` therefore switches maps only when the requested
   map differs from the current one.
2. A map switch returns before the new world is actually serviceable, so the next
   call times out. :func:`ensure_map` polls the new world until it answers
   consistently.
3. Loading a heavy map can kill the server outright. :class:`CarlaServer` can
   therefore start, stop and restart the simulator process, and
   :func:`connect_with_retry` transparently waits for a server that is still
   booting.

Passing the map on the command line was also tested and is *not* honoured by the
packaged 0.9.15 build (it boots the default map regardless), so map selection
always goes through :func:`ensure_map`.
