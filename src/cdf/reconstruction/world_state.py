"""The recorder's perceived semantic state over time, from its own evidence only.

Every state variable is a timeline whose value is True, False or UNKNOWN:

  True / False  established from this recorder's own evidence
  UNKNOWN       the recorder cannot establish it: before its first observation,
                while an estimate is too uncertain, or after the subject was lost

A value holds from the sample where it was established until evidence changes
it (an uncertain sample in between neither confirms nor refutes it), so the
events are exactly the transitions of a variable into and out of True.  Losing
sight of a subject (TRACK_LOST) moves its states to UNKNOWN; that is not an
END and no END is invented for it.  There is no separate visibility state:
TRACK_APPEARED_* / TRACK_LOST and the sign detection windows already say when
a subject is observed.  A track enters the state at its first observation; a
sign, once detected, stays known.

``snapshot(t, before=True)`` is the state just BEFORE ``t``: none of the
transitions at ``t`` are applied, so every event at one timestamp shares it.
``snapshot(t, before=False)`` includes the transitions at ``t`` (the state after
them), as stored in each trace frame.  External subjects keep their local
names (``track_001``, ``sign-0``): no global identity enters a local state.
