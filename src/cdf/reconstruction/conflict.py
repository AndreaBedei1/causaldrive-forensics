"""Collision course, braking avoidability and safe following distance of a radar track: the CRITICAL_TTC model.

CRITICAL_TTC is true for either of two reasons (``critical_reason``):

* PREDICTED_OVERLAP: a predicted 2-D collision course that braking can no longer
  avoid with the available deceleration (points 1-3 below);
* UNSAFE_FORWARD_GAP: a road user ahead of the recorder, in its path or entering
  it from just beside it, is closer than the safe following distance (point 4),
  whether or not the two are on a collision course at their current speeds.

CRITICAL_TTC is the event's historical name: a forward gap can be unsafe while the
classical TTC is infinite (two cars at the same speed 3 m apart never meet), so an
UNSAFE_FORWARD_GAP alone has no TTC (``ttc_s`` None).  A time headway is not a TTC.

Everything is local to one recorder: its own odometry (speed, yaw rate), its own
footprint and one smoothed radar track.  At each track sample the future is
predicted over ``prediction_horizon_s`` in the recorder's vehicle frame:

  recorder  its footprint, inflated into a safety envelope (the standstill
            margin d0 ahead and behind, ``critical_lateral_margin_m`` at the
            sides), moving along its current path: constant speed and yaw rate
            (a circular arc, a straight line when not turning);
  target    a box of nominal size (``target_length_m`` x ``target_width_m``: the
            radar measures no size) placed behind its observed near surface
            (the corner towards the recorder when seen obliquely, the middle of
            the facing side when seen along one of its axes) and moving at its
            estimated velocity.  Its velocity across the recorder's heading
            counts only beyond the estimate's uncertainty (a car's null
            hypothesis is to keep its lane).  A target decelerating at least
            ``target_braking_min_mps2`` keeps its measured deceleration until
            it stops.

1. COLLISION COURSE: the two boxes overlap somewhere within the horizon.  The
   time of the first overlap is the TTC; the span of overlapping instants is the
   temporal overlap of the two vehicles in the conflict area.  A target that
   approaches radially but passes ahead of or behind the recorder never
   overlaps: no collision course, whatever its range rate.  A target already
   inside the envelope counts only while it still closes in.
2. AVOIDANCE BY BRAKING: the smallest deceleration that removes every overlap
   when the braking vehicle reacts after ``critical_reaction_time_s`` and then
   brakes along its path until it stops (bisection; the overlap disappears
   monotonically with harder braking).  The braking vehicle is the recorder
   when its braking can avoid the conflict (it closes on the target, or crosses
   its path); when even an instant stop of the recorder cannot (a target
   closing in from behind or from the side), it is the target, with the same
   reaction time.
3. CRITICAL: a collision course whose required deceleration is at least the
   available one (``critical_deceleration_mps2``), claimed only while the track
   estimate is precise enough (``max_position_std_m``, ``max_velocity_std_mps``,
   as for CUT_IN) and the track at least ``critical_min_track_age_s`` old: a
   young track's velocity is not yet known (the smoother's uncertainty at a
   track's first samples already draws on later data and understates it).

For a target ahead in the same lane points 1-3 check whether the recorder can
still stop short of the target as it moves now (keeping its speed, or its
measured deceleration when it brakes): a car ahead at the recorder's own speed
is never on a collision course, however close it is.  Point 4 adds what that
misses: the room the recorder would need if the vehicle ahead braked.  For
crossing traffic the space-time overlap of the two predicted footprints
replaces any one-dimensional distance: a car that crosses ahead of or behind the
recorder's envelope is not on a collision course, whatever its range rate.

4. SAFE FOLLOWING DISTANCE (UNSAFE_FORWARD_GAP).  The longitudinal clearance
   from the recorder's front face to the rear face of the target's nominal box,
   along the recorder's heading (never the radar range), is compared with

       d_min = max(v_ego * t_front(v_ego), critical_min_following_distance_m = 2 m)

   where v_ego is the recorder's own speed and t_front the minimum following time
   gap of UN Regulation No. 157 (ALKS, vehicles M1 / N1): 1.0 s at 7.2 km/h,
   1.1 s at 10, 1.2 s at 20, 1.3 s at 30, 1.4 s at 40, 1.5 s at 50, 1.6 s at
   60 km/h, linear in between, the first and last values held outside the table
   (no extrapolation above 60 km/h; below 7.2 km/h the 2 m minimum rules).  No
   margin is added and the target's speed is not used: the gap can be unsafe
   when the target is as fast as the recorder, or a little faster.  The braking
   avoidability of points 2-3 (reaction time, decelerations) is not part of it.

   It applies only to a road user that is a leader of the recorder: moving in
   the same direction (SAME_DIRECTION encounter), its body ahead of the
   recorder's front face, either overlapping the path corridor
   (``path_half_width_m`` either side of the heading) or within
   ``critical_front_lateral_margin_m`` of it while approaching it laterally
   (``critical_front_lateral_speed_mps`` beyond the estimate's uncertainty), and
   with the recorder itself moving (at least ``critical_forward_min_speed_mps``,
   the MOVING threshold; from 1 to 2 m/s the 2 m minimum binds).  A car beside
   or behind the recorder, a car keeping its own lane next to the corridor and a
   car further away are never critical for this reason (they still are when the
   2-D prediction finds a collision course).  Without a predicted overlap there
   is no TTC: ``ttc_s`` stays None (a time headway is not a TTC).  Hysteresis:
   the reason starts when the clearance drops below d_min and holds until it
   exceeds ``critical_forward_release_factor`` x d_min (or the target stops
   being a leader), with the state's 0.2 s release debounce.  The estimate gates
   of point 3 apply, and a track seen
   past another tracked vehicle (``TrackSample.occluded``) gives no evidence
   either way for this reason, since its returns may be hidden by or mixed with
   that vehicle's.

The safe distance follows the idea of art. 149 of the Italian Highway Code (keep
a distance that lets the recorder stop in time and avoid a collision with the
vehicle ahead) and of Directive 2006/126/EC (adequate distance to the vehicles
in front and at the side, speed that allows stopping within the free distance),
which prescribe no numbers.  UN R157 regulates automated lane keeping systems:
its time-gap table is used here as a technical reference, not as a universal
law of human driving, and no single European "critical TTC" threshold exists.
UN R152 (AEBS) asks for at least 5 m/s^2 of braking demand when a collision is
imminent; the reaction time and deceleration of the collision-course model are
modelling assumptions of this reconstruction, not values prescribed by EU or
UNECE rules.

Parameters are global and documented in ``configs/reconstruction.yaml``.  Limits:
constant velocity / yaw rate (no intent, no lane geometry), a nominal target
size, braking as the only avoidance manoeuvre (no swerve), one track at a time
for the prediction (no occlusion of the predicted paths by third vehicles).
